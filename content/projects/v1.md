My 9.0/10.0 Bachelor Thesis, where I explored the effects of conflicting feedback on the agentâ€™s performance when using
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We analyse the impact of environmental complexity and examine various
query selection strategies. Our results show that RLHF performance rapidly degrades with even minimal conflicting
feedback in simple environments, and current query selection strategies are ineffective in handling feedback diversity.
